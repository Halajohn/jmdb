1) kdp uses receivePacket() in SocketConnection.java to get packet from debugger (jmdb),
   receivePacket() will see the length in packet header to receive the whole packet from debugger,
   and then process that packet based on its cmdset and cmd in packet header, or forward that packet
   to the KVM.
   
   Thus if I forget to send the required size of a packet, then the kdp will still wait to
   receive that packet, and not forward it to the KVM.
   
   As a result, the KVM still blocks in the read socket call because KVM doesn't receive any
   byte from the kdp.
